"Automation Steals the Show": Earl B. Abrams reports on the 1955 NARTB convention, highlighting Ampex/Tinkham. He notes the connection between automation and remote transmitter control and mentions Paul Schafer, who would build his first automation system the following year and go on to play a large role in popularizing both technologies.
