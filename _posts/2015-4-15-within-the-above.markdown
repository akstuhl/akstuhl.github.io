"Within the Above" was a collaborative work hosted by [Gallery 263](http://gallery263.com) in Cambridge, MA for the first installment of their Hybrids series. [Leigh Kaulbach](http://leighkaulbach.com) sculpted paper-based elements to transform the gallery into a visual space evoking love as a universal energy, while I designed a generative sound piece that recycled vocal recordings evoking moments of love through the room and transformed the voices into a textural wash. 

The three-day run of the piece included two performances of the sound piece, inviting audience participation, as well as open gallery hours during which a looped version of the piece ran.
