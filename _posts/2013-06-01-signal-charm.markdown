["Signal Charm"](http://akstuhl.net/signalcharm/) is a short electronic fiction piece I developed in [Scott Hutchins](http://www.scotthutchins.com/)' Twitter Fiction and Future Forms course, offered under Stanford's [Creative Writing](http://creativewriting.stanford.edu/) program.

The piece presents a fictional narrative through an interactive hypertext format built using HTML, CSS and jQuery. You can view the full piece [here](http://akstuhl.net/signalcharm/).
