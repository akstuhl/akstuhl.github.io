As part of my work on HyperStudio's [Annotation Studio](http://www.annotationstudio.org) application, I've been prototyping a set of interactive visualizations to help demonstrate patterns in student annotation activity, in collaboration with our communications officer and instructors using the software. [This working draft](http://web.mit.edu/akstuhl/www/annotation-vis), built with [D3.js](http://d3js.org), visualizes a complete and assessed set of annotations made over the course of a reading assignment by students in a Spanish language class.
