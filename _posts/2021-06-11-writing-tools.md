I've been using Scott Selisker's [Scrivener-inspired plain text writing workflow](http://u.arizona.edu/~selisker/post/workflow/), which relies on the free software tools [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/), since starting my PhD. I also take notes in Markdown, the simple markup language that the workflow uses for academic drafting.

I've made a few plug-ins to go with this setup and other plain text pursuits:

- [`notes-from-pdf`](https://atom.io/packages/notes-from-pdf), an Atom package that improves the process of copy-pasting quotations from a PDF into a text file
- [`pandoc-interface-yaml`](https://atom.io/packages/pandoc-interface-yaml), an Atom package that lets you export to various document formats using the options needed for citation formatting, etc.
- [`wc-tracker`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wc-tracker), a command line tool and Node.js module for tracking word count changes to one or more documents
- [`rpg-dice`](https://atom.io/packages/rpg-dice), an Atom package for making Dungeons & Dragons-style dice rolls directly in a text editor (this one is not so much a boost to the academic writing productivity)
