Listening in Code: Process and Politics in Interactive Musical Works

Master's thesis, MIT Comparative Media Studies, 2016

Abstract:

> As everyday musical experiences move further into software platforms, an interest among musicians in taking fuller advantage of computational media produces a strand of interactive, software-based musical works I call *open mediational music*. This phenomenon stands apart from other types of creative work centered on music and interaction by valorizing the listenerâ€™s responsibility for instantiating musical works. It also advances an agenda of openness with respect to interactivity as a principle of new media. I center four case studies on a set of interactive musical works that exemplify this phenomenon: [Reflective][1] by Reiko Yamada, [Thicket][2] by Morgan Packard and Joshue Ott, [Jazz.Computer][3] by Yotam Mann and Sarah Rothberg, and [Baggage Allowance][4] by Pamela Z. Each of these works takes shape out of unique motivations and in different forms and settings. Collectively, they advance a notion of *platforms* as objects of critical awareness and propose *listening* as a model for mindful participation in algorithmic environments. Illuminating the distinct claims that sound and software hold on one another as creative domains, open mediational music invites listeners to rehearse a conscientious engagement with the sites and conditions of computationally mediated cultural encounter.
