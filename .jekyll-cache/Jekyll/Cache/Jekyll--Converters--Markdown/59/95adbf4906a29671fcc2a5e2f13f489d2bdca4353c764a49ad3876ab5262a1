I"ç<p>Despite a more vigorous starter (when I mixed the dough, it had just started subsiding after a lot of bubbling on top), this half batch of levain dough again didnâ€™t seem to rise very much overnight. The dramatic drop in temperature, with snow today after two very sunny days in the 60s, surely didnâ€™t help. I divided the dough into three balls after 14 hours, making smaller balls this time in order to try making smaller, round pies with puffier outer crusts than last time.</p>
