I"<p>The composer Pauline Oliveros, who passed away recently at the age of 84, leaves behind a many-threaded legacy of musical adventuring amid vigorous support for colleagues, as Geeta Dayal <a href="https://frieze.com/article/pauline-oliveros-1932-2016">documents</a> in an obituary for <em>Frieze</em>. In all these pursuits, and in her <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=9E01EEDE143CE531A15750C1A96F9C946190D6CF">writing</a>, Oliveros’ voice was harsh in its directness and uplifting in its clarity — the fruit of a rare commitment to distilling avant-garde ambitions into simple vessels. Her series of “sonic meditations” makes that effort particularly apparent. In these poetically honed written works, she addresses the reader with instructions that, when followed by a group, bring the musical piece into being and the participant listeners into transformative states of awareness. I first learned about Oliveros in an intro computer music course when we performed one of these pieces, <em>Teach Yourself to Fly</em>.</p>
