I"><p>Mixed dough between 9 and 10 last night, with a starter that was pretty weak. The apartment was coolâ€”70 degrees when I checked mid-morning, and Iâ€™m sure somewhat cooler overnightâ€”and the dough had only added half an inch or so to its height in the tub by the time I checked it, about 12 hours after mixing. I waited till 2pm to divide it in the hopes that it would rise a bit more, but it stayed about the same level while bubbles formed and popped at the top. The divided dough balls had more visible bubbles around their exteriors than did the last batch, which was also facing cool temperatures and a weak starter but which I divided no more than 14 hours after mixing.</p>

<p>This time I also made a full recipe from the Forkish book, which Iâ€™ve normally divided into five balls in the past; this time I made four, so the crusts should be considerably bigger than the last couple rounds where Iâ€™ve made a half recipe and three balls. I wanted to do this since it seems like assembling the pie directly on top of the baking stone is the way to do it (though fairly chaotic and wasteful of oven heat). I think a slightly thicker crust with a slightly wider diameter than last time will work well, especially if Iâ€™ve succeeded in getting more yeast activity with the longer ferment.</p>

<p>I made two pies the day after putting the divided dough balls in the fridge. Sauce for both was canned crushed tomatoes with salt and oregano mixed in, and cheese was a block of low-moisture mozzarella broken into small pieces by hand. Toppings for the first were big basil leaves, mushrooms, and baby arugula that I tossed in olive oil and salt and added after I took the pie out of the oven. Nice flavors all around, and the basil made it smell incredible while it was cooking. On the second I used sauteed broccoli, sliced onion, and some smaller basil leaves. That trio produced a kind of veggie fried rice flavor that wasnâ€™t what I aimed for, but otherwise good. Both crusts turned out well, but could have been considerably puffier with a more vigorous starter/dough. The quantity seemed right for making a pie just about as big as the baking stone can accommodate. I assembled the pies directly on the stone again, and the crust was floppy but not undercooked at the center. The block mozzarella didnâ€™t start to brown any later than shredded, and the shredded yields a better consistency. This was store-brand mozzarella from Market Basket, so fancier stuff might behave differently. Another note for next time: be very sparing with switching to the broiler at the end of baking: I think this step in the Forkish recipes is really meant to char the upper reaches of a very puffy crust, and itâ€™s easy to overdo if Iâ€™m waiting on a lower-lying crust to darken; plus a charred basil leaf is a bummer.</p>

<p>All in all: good pies, fresh basil is killer, arugula/oil/salt topper is worth repeating; had hoped for puffier crust edges but also feared Iâ€™d overtax the stone, so Iâ€™ll call it a success. Leigh and I accompanied them with <a href="https://www.saveur.com/gin-campari-sour-cocktail-recipe/">gin campari sours</a> (motivated by having a bunch of egg whites left over from using the yolks in a meatball recipe last week) and a Sopranos episode.</p>
