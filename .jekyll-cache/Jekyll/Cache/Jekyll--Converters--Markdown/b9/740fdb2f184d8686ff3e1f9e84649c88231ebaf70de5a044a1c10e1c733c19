I"®<p>Mixed dough between 9 and 10 last night, with a starter that was pretty weak. The apartment was coolâ€”70 degrees when I checked mid-morning, and Iâ€™m sure somewhat cooler overnightâ€”and the dough had only added half an inch or so to its height in the tub by the time I checked it, about 12 hours after mixing. I waited till 2pm to divide it in the hopes that it would rise a bit more, but it stayed about the same level while bubbles formed and popped at the top. The divided dough balls had more visible bubbles around their exteriors than did the last batch, which was also facing cool temperatures and a weak starter but which I divided no more than 14 hours after mixing.</p>
