<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As everyday musical experiences move further into software platforms, an interest among musicians in taking fuller advantage of computational media produces a strand of interactive, software-based musical works I call <em>open mediational music</em>. This phenomenon stands apart from other types of creative work centered on music and interaction by valorizing the listenerâ€™s responsibility for instantiating musical works. It also advances an agenda of openness with respect to interactivity as a principle of new media. I center four case studies on a set of interactive musical works that exemplify this phenomenon: <a href="http://www.reikoyamada.com/Reiko_Yamada/Reflective.html">Reflective</a> by Reiko Yamada, <a href="http://apps.intervalstudios.com/thicket/">Thicket</a> by Morgan Packard and Joshue Ott, <a href="http://jazz.computer">Jazz.Computer</a> by Yotam Mann and Sarah Rothberg, and <a href="http://www.baggageallowance.tv/">Baggage Allowance</a> by Pamela Z. Each of these works takes shape out of unique motivations and in different forms and settings. Collectively, they advance a notion of <em>platforms</em> as objects of critical awareness and propose <em>listening</em> as a model for mindful participation in algorithmic environments. Illuminating the distinct claims that sound and software hold on one another as creative domains, open mediational music invites listeners to rehearse a conscientious engagement with the sites and conditions of computationally mediated cultural encounter.</p>
