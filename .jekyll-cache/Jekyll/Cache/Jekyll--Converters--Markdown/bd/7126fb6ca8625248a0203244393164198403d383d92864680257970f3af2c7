<p><a href="/mixed_messages.html">Mixed Messages</a> was a 40-day correspondence between <a href="http://leighkaulbach.com">Leigh Kaulbach</a> and me. Each partner produced and sent one item per day. Working from Lawrence, KS, Leigh created text and images on paper and sent them by USPS mail to me in Cambridge, MA. I designed sounds prompted by Leighâ€™s communications and sent them to Leigh electronically, posting each sound alongside a photo of the mail I received from her that day. On receiving a sound, Leigh would create her next piece as a visual evocation of that sound, and so on.</p>
