I"ı<p>â€œWithin the Aboveâ€ was a collaborative work hosted by <a href="http://gallery263.com">Gallery 263</a> in Cambridge, MA for the first installment of their Hybrids series. <a href="http://leighkaulbach.com">Leigh Kaulbach</a> sculpted paper-based elements to transform the gallery into a visual space evoking love as a universal energy, while I designed a generative sound piece that recycled vocal recordings evoking moments of love through the room and transformed the voices into a textural wash.</p>
