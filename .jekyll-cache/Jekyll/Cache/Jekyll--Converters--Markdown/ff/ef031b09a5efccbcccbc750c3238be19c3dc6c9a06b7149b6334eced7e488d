I"ğ<p>A fun batch! Full-on summer weather starting with a heat wave last week has meant an actually successfully launched starter; when I said â€œmore vigorousâ€ about the starter as of the last batch, that was relative to a literal non-starter. The starter is now actually expanding and bubbling within a few hours of each feeding, with a spongy rather than liquid texture, and this dough batch reflected it. I mixed the dough starting around 7:30 last night and divided it around 9:30 this morning, by which point it had not just doubled (as the recipe aims for) but expanded maybe as much as eight-fold. I definitely should have caught it earlier on, as the recipe says 12-14 hours; but it wasnâ€™t even particularly hot in the kitchen overnight.</p>
