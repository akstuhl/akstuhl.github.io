I"[<p>A fun batch! Full-on summer weather starting with a heat wave last week has meant an actually successfully launched starter; when I said “more vigorous” about the starter as of the last batch, that was relative to a literal non-starter. The starter is now actually expanding and bubbling within a few hours of each feeding, with a spongy rather than liquid texture, and this dough batch reflected it. I mixed the dough starting around 7:30 last night and divided it around 9:30 this morning, by which point it had not just doubled (as the recipe aims for) but expanded maybe as much as eight-fold. I definitely should have caught it earlier on, as the recipe says 12-14 hours; but it wasn’t even particularly hot in the kitchen overnight.</p>

<p>The weather (and a portable propane grill that my mother-in-law recently gave us) has also meant outdoor cooking, so this batch was my first attempt at grill pizza. It’s an interesting process and fairly different final product from an oven pizza with the same ingredients, but I was very happy with it. The approach I took, based on a Serious Eats post, was to first cook the dough on high heat until beginning to brown, then flip it over and cook the (now bubbly) other side until partly charred, then reduce heat, flip over once again, and assemble the toppings. Stretching the dough was a bit tricky as I didn’t think to bring flour down and set up a surface where I could press it first. Luckily it was pretty forgiving, and the high crispiness thanks to the grill made some uneven / very thin parts much less an issue than they could have been.</p>

<p>I think that sequence of flipping is the right way to go about it, but the timing and heat are tricky. With the first pie, I cooked the bottom side too long in the first step, so by the time the cheese had fully melted in the last step, parts of the crust had charred too much. I managed a little better with the second pie, but still would have liked to give the toppings more heat than they got. In the future I’ll try to use very little sauce (or maybe grill then slice whole tomatoes instead?), maybe try chunks of mozzarella instead of shredded, and definitely pre-grill toppings wherever possible. I topped that first pie with broccoli and Italian sausage, both grilled right beforehand, and those were delicious. The second one I topped with mushrooms and then arugula after it came off the grill, and the mushrooms did actually cook enough to taste good but could have been better. We accompanied the pizzas with grilled asparagus and had a really nice picnic table dinner while the sun went down and the cat stalked around at the edge of the woods.</p>

<p>Takeaways: this batch probably over-fermented; though the sourdough flavor didn’t cross into excessive range, I suspect I could get better texture and bubbling if I divide and refrigerate it earlier on. Grill pizza is well worth the trade-offs! I should try to come up with some different grill-friendly toppings that I wouldn’t use on an oven pie.</p>

<p>Add-on: made an oven pie with the remaining dough ball from this batch, which produced the best crust I’ve gotten in working memory. Some very big bubbles at edge, consistently crispy with some charring on top (without using the broiler!), and flavorful but not too sour, despite three full days in the fridge. Tough to compare to the grill attempt, since pressing it out on a floured cutting board definitely helped, but this crust was definitely better. For toppings, I sautéed turnip greens and cut up some oyster mushrooms we got at the farmers’ market yesterday. A little light on cheese, and the mushroom flavor mostly got lost in the mix, but on the other hand everything cooked well, with the crust starting to brown before the cheese; I suspect that less density in the dough means less moisture holding it back from toasting. Seems there’s basically no problem that an actually functioning starter doesn’t ameliorate!</p>
