I"É<p>‚ÄúWithin the Above‚Äù was a collaborative work hosted by <a href="http://gallery263.com">Gallery 263</a> in Cambridge, MA for the first installment of their Hybrids series. <a href="http://leighkaulbach.com">Leigh Kaulbach</a> sculpted paper-based elements to transform the gallery into a visual space evoking love as a universal energy, while I designed a generative sound piece that recycled vocal recordings evoking moments of love through the room and transformed the voices into a textural wash.</p>

<p>The three-day run of the piece included two performances of the sound piece, inviting audience participation, as well as open gallery hours during which a looped version of the piece ran.</p>
