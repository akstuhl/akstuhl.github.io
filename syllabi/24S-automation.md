<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>What is the nature of automation? From mechanical looms in the 19th
century to generative AI tools in the 21st, labor-saving technology has
always provoked warnings of accelerating exploitation—and, at the same
time, visions of a future society freed from drudgery. In this course,
we will call on central texts and concepts in Science, Technology, and
Society to help us understand how automation has been proposed,
implemented, and resisted in specific contexts. More than its nature, we
will examine automation’s <em>cultures</em>: how have ambitions to
automate different areas of human activity reflected and reinforced the
different ways we want to live together?</p>
<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this course, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use STS concepts to assess claims about automation’s past and
predicted effects on work and society</li>
<li>Describe the social and historical context under which automation
became a public controversy in the postwar United States</li>
<li>Identify relations between technology and labor in your own work or
leisure activities</li>
<li>Formulate your own informed opinions about future directions for
automation/AI</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-structure-and-class-structure">Course structure and class
structure</h3>
<p>This course will organize material into three modules. In our first
two weeks, we will discuss automation in general terms and begin to get
a sense of its historical contours. The following six weeks will take us
through a variety of particular contexts in which authors have studied
automation’s implementation and effects. In the final six weeks, we will
first zoom back out to see how STS frameworks can apply across contexts,
then turn toward perspectives that have likewise collected resistant
worker perspectives across different settings.</p>
<p>Most weeks have readings assigned for both class meetings, though a
few Thursday sessions will instead be devoted to project preparation. We
will spend the bulk of our class time discussing the readings together,
guided by your reading responses. Some Tuesday meetings will feature
more talking from me in a mini-lecture format.</p>
<h3
id="project-scripting-and-de-scripting-automation-in-context">Project:
scripting and de-scripting automation in context</h3>
<p>The course will culminate with a final project in which you apply
concepts from our readings and discussions to a context of your
choosing. In this two-stage assignment, you will first select a
<em>working context</em> and then describe how automation might
transform it—from the perspective of an automation planner and from the
perspective of a worker strategizing against automation.</p>
<p>In part 1, we will work together in class to brainstorm and identify
working contexts at an appropriate scale for the assignment. You will
then produce a short written or audiovisual report that identifies: A)
how work has historically been organized, observed, and compensated in
this context; B) how automation, computers, or other control
technologies have so far factored into this work; and C) a particular
routine that is essential within this work.</p>
<p>In part 2, each student will write an essay in two subparts: first,
drawing on Madeline Akrich’s concept of “scripts,” you will propose how
a machine could replace part of the routine you identified in part 1.B.
Second, drawing on Akrich’s method of “de-scription,” they will propose
a set of tactics by which workers might adjust the routine and make that
replacement ineffective.</p>
<h3 id="weekly-reading-responses">Weekly reading responses</h3>
<p>Your assignment for each day a reading is listed, to be posted to our
Canvas page <strong>by 9pm the evening before our class
meeting</strong>, is to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>read the assigned reading(s),</li>
<li>pick a <em>single sentence</em> from <em>one</em> reading that
either
<ol type="A">
<li><em>confused</em> you the most <strong>or</strong></li>
<li><em>excited</em> you the most; then,</li>
</ol></li>
<li>type out the sentence and note the page number, and</li>
<li>as briefly as possible, explain
<ol type="i">
<li>why, in your own words, understanding this sentence should help us
understand what the author wanted to accomplish with this piece,
<strong>and</strong></li>
<li>why it confused/excited you.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Some elaboration on the above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A</code> and <code>B</code> don’t always need to be different
things—it could be the case that the most confusing and exciting parts
of a text are the same part for you. But for clarity’s sake, I encourage
you to indicate “confused” or “excited” unless you specifically feel
both about the sentence in question. “Excited” could also mean
“annoyed”—disagreement with authors is very welcome here, as long as you
explain your thinking.</li>
<li>By “as briefly as possible,” I mean that writing one sentence each
for parts <code>i</code> and <code>ii</code> is sufficient. If it takes
more words to explain your thinking, feel free to use them. A successful
response here is <em>specific</em>, not lengthy.</li>
<li>Our Canvas page will include examples of effective responses, and we
will periodically check in about how the format can better serve our
in-class discussions.</li>
</ul>
