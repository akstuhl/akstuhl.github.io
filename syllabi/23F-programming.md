<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Computer code underpins everything from scientific research to
cultural production. It is at once a vast, distributed infrastructure
and a mundane textual object. In this reading lab we will consider the
work of writing, controlling, and maintaining information systems—and
the <em>programmer</em> as a social construction that performs and is
defined by this work. Who gets to be a programmer? What does it mean to
program today, and what has it meant in the past? The authors in this
syllabus have explained and critiqued computing. They have traced the
power relations that give programming not just industrial but social
significance. They have recovered moments when computing held particular
coercive or liberatory connotations that have since fallen away from
mainstream attitudes toward software. Some have proposed new ways that
computing can serve a more just society, reconceiving the programmer as
a bearer of socio-technical responsibility. This course may complement
coursework in Computer Science, but it assumes no prior experience with
coding and aims to provide equally relevant context for any of the
myriad scientific and engineering domains to which programming has
become infrastructural.</p>
<h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use STS concepts to examine computer code and its applications</li>
<li>Become a more critical reader of code, software interfaces, software
industry rhetoric, and tech criticism</li>
<li>Become a more adept and strategic reader of academic writing</li>
<li>Relate new developments in computation to historical precedents</li>
<li>Understand the present social and professional structures that
surround software development in American and global contexts</li>
<li>Begin developing informed opinions about how programming should
function in your society</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-structure-and-class-structure">Course structure and class
structure</h3>
<p>This first four weeks of the course will focus on historical
perspectives. In week five, we will step away from the computational
sense of “programming” to consider how other meanings of the word
operate in separate but connected contexts. Weeks six through ten will
focus on significant social forces presently shaping the work of
programming. In the remaining weeks, we will consider the limits and
potentials of programming as a profession and as a sociotechnical
activity, often by way of critiques that authors have helped enact
beyond writing.</p>
<p>Each class session will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of each student’s assigned comment on the reading</li>
<li>Opportunities to reflect on how other coursework connects to this
course’s concepts</li>
<li>Context for the coming week’s reading</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="classroom-and-email-etiquette">Classroom and email
etiquette</h3>
<p>Please call me Andy in class and when writing. I use he/him/his
pronouns. If there is anything you’d like me to know about how you
prefer to be addressed and you would be more comfortable telling me by
email than in a class session, I would be very glad to hear from
you.</p>
<p>When emailing with a question, please double check this syllabus and
our Canvas page for the answer first. Keep in mind that I generally
won’t answer email outside of weekdays 9am–5pm (and won’t expect you to,
either).</p>
<h3 id="weekly-assignment">Weekly assignment</h3>
<p>Your assignment each week from Sept 11 onward, which you will share
with the class via our Canvas page <strong>by 9pm Monday
evening</strong>, is to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>read the assigned readings,</li>
<li>pick a <em>single sentence</em> from <em>one</em> reading that
either
<ol type="A">
<li><em>confused</em> you the most <strong>or</strong></li>
<li><em>excited</em> you the most; then,</li>
</ol></li>
<li>type out the sentence and note the page number, and</li>
<li>as briefly as possible, explain
<ol type="i">
<li>what you think it means, in your own words,
<strong>and</strong></li>
<li>why it confused/excited you.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Some elaboration on the above:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>A</code> and <code>B</code> don’t always need to be
different things—it could be the case that the most confusing and
exciting parts of a text are the same part for you. But for clarity’s
sake, I encourage you to indicate “confused” or “excited” unless you
specifically feel both about the sentence in question. “Excited” could
also mean “annoyed”—disagreement with authors is very welcome here, as
long as you explain your thinking.</p></li>
<li><p>By “as briefly as possible,” I mean that writing one sentence
each for parts <code>i</code> and <code>ii</code> is sufficient. If it
takes more words to explain your thinking, feel free to use them. A
successful response here is <em>specific</em>, not lengthy.</p></li>
<li><p>Here are two examples of how an effective response might
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Against this nostalgia, Butler, following Jacques Derrida, argues
that iterability lies behind the effectiveness of performative
utterances” (Chun, page 28). This sentence basically seems to mean that
to say something convincingly, you have to say it a bunch of times. It
confused me because there is clearly some serious philosophy involved
here, and I don’t see why it’s needed to set up the paragraph’s pretty
obvious point that “the programmer/user… is produced through the act of
programming.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rather than starting with an explanation of the computer processes
involved, they explained time-sharing from the user’s point of view—how
a user accessed the machine, the commands entered by the user, and how
the user exited the system” (Rankin, page 29). This sentence describes
how the designers of BASIC made an instruction manual for new
programmers instead of a technical document for advanced ones. It
excited me because in my experience it’s still a problem that
documentation for a lot of code tools starts with jargony technical
explanations, and it can be really hard for a new user to even find
setup instructions for trying them out. It’s interesting that people
were already confronting this problem in the 1960s.</p>
