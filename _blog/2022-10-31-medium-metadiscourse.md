It's been very fun and heartening in the last week to see a big wave of people I followed on Twitter moving over to open source federated alternatives, namely Mastodon (or its fork Hometown, in my case). There are a lot of good blog posts making the rounds where people offer tips on getting oriented in the fediverse and reflections on its differences from Twitter; this is not one of those. Rather, I want to reflect on this present and probably brief period where such a huge portion of what people are posting on Mastodon is _about_ Mastodon – this moment of lively medium metadiscourse as people help each other explore a new kind of communication channel.

As Susan Douglas documented in _Inventing American Broadcasting_, a major use of the airwaves was for amateur operators to hold club meetings where they would tackle technical problems and 

This is not to say that we should glamorize medium metadiscourse. Douglas's book shows how a specific complex of white, middle-class masculinity, bolstered by hero-inventor stories, propelled these amateur operators.

Mastodon's test will be how many people ride each platform migration wave to a place where they feel settled and comfortable with a group of people they can and want to talk with. If
