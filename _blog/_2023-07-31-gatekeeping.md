This blog post from Erin Kissane got me thinking about comparisons between "fediverse" sites and radio, much like the [last time I posted here]. Kissane has been on a quest to parse out the reasons people get turned away from Mastodon, which is a necessary (and all too thankless) project if we want more folks to jump over to what I think is ultimately a very promising and already refreshing alternative to ad-driven social media. But this latest post sparked a specific point of recognition for me thanks to one of the categories Kissane derived from people's narratives about trying and abandoning Mastodon: "get yelled at, feel bad."

"Get yelled at, feel bad" was, I regret to say, a pretty common fate that befell new trainees at the community radio station where I volunteered in college. Here was the typical sequence: a college freshman, in those precious few months before they'd get overwhelmed with options and obligations, signs up for the station volunteer training class; they attend the 10-week course, enduring an onslaught of details about microphone technique and FCC enforcement precedents that turns away a good chunk of their peers; they complete the requisite volunteer hours to earn airtime by refiling CDs in the library; they tell all their dormmates to tune in for their first radio show; they play Imagine Dragons because it's what they and their friends are into; they get screamed at by someone called Ragnarok420 on the station listserv; they move on to one of the many campus activities that involve partying with their friends instead of reading email screeds from Gen X strangers.

This was, each time it happened, a loss for the station, whether Ragnarok420 saw it that way or not. It was mostly a loss in aggregate: we did not have a full program schedule, most students were unaware of us, and institutional memory at a college station is always extremely short and precarious (this, along with the predations of campus administrators, dealt an often lethal blow to many stations during the first couple years of COVID). I might not have seen it that way---listserv drama can be fun, as can laughing in nervous relief as someone's musical naivety exceeds your own---had I not happened to be the training director, tasked with recruiting and retaining these students. 

Some of this, to be sure, was my fault: it is harder, in a training class, to instill respect for the musical contours of the freeform radio ethic in a training class than it is to instill fear about what might happen to the station if you say "fuck" in a mic break at 2pm; but that doesn't make it less important. Still, there is a bit of a contradiction 

And I'm sure I could have stepped up for these trainees better than I did

The point of comparison, finally, back to Mastodon is simply that no amount of technical preparation and effortful onboarding can fully solve the problem of 

Cultural norms have to change; not in the sense that people should give up the values they have attached to the medium, but rather that they need to do some reflection and be able to make those values explicit.

This is about the extent of where the analogy holds up. And as I thought about it, I realized I was more interested in the ways that it doesn't. The big one is that, according to Kissane and consistent with what I've observed, the gatekeeping on Mastodon comes predominantly from people with deep investments in free and open source software. They want Mastodon, as a medium, to be about itself, or rather about the category of software of which it is part (this is the only conclusion one can draw from hearing the argument, which Kissane has rightly lambasted, that the software has "productive barriers to entry.") In contrast, the gatekeeping I witnessed at KZSU was squarely about music---_not_ about radio. This lines up with what [Don Joyce observed](http://www.somewhere.org/work_excerpts/joyce/media/show.htm) in 1989/1994, that "radio is primarily about the record industry."
