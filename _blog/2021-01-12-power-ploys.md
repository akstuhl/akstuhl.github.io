Last week's deadly, preemptive coup attempt threw a long-standing American dissonance into sharp relief: how supporters of the reactionary right seem to respond reflexively to their own political power with aggressive despair at their _lack_ of power. QAnon, after all, has provided its members an exercise in answering (or forestalling the need to answer) the question, _why hasn't Trump really done anything despite occupying the most powerful position in the world?_ But as QAnon acolytes and their alternative information spheres have attracted plenty of attention in recent days for obvious reasons, the strategist-pundit class that does the bulk of discourse-shaping in "traditional" media venues—and who have held together the contradictory empowered-disempowerment complex on which Trumpism seizes—has largely evaded self-reflection. The far-right counterpart of this group understands that they wield power and also (privately) understands that one of the activities key to maintaining power is (publicly) insisting that they wield no power. The center-right and left-of-center contingents, meanwhile, through some combination of gullibility and egoism, vastly and publicly overestimate the amount of power that they wield. This combination results in a number of phenomena that benefit the far-right:

1) By dramatically overstating the significance of the center-left's hold on a few cultural institutions (college campuses and certain sectors of the entertainment industry) and conflating this hold (which has a capacity to inconvenience some flagrantly bad actors but not, for instance, to prevent them from winning a presidential race) with actual political power, center-right and left-of-center pundits have enthusiastically sustained a critique of their own supposed power under terms ("cancel culture") set by the far-right. All kinds of open contradictions regarding civil liberties, censorship, and the limits of acceptable civic discourse flourish in the gap produced by a wide ideological cohort believing that the politically empowered right acts out of a culturally walled-in desperation.

2) Believing the far-right's claims that any of its political victories result from excessive power held by the "left" in the cultural sphere, left-of-center pundits in particular have helped describe the far-right's coalition in ways that do not reflect political reality but are both socially gratifying to the center-left and politically useful to the far-right. The wave of patronizing, "empathy"-seeking portraits of life in the "flyover states" or "Trump country" that followed the 2016 election in outlets like the New York Times formed the sharpest example. These stories fixated on the "white working class," developing and distorting one fragment of Trump's coalition into a romantic metonym that the wealthier bulk of the GOP base gladly took up. As Tommy Craggs [put it](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/12/whats-the-matter-with-cultural-politics/) last month, Democratic pundits eagerly fuel this narrative where "members of the working class—by which is always meant the white working class and very often, incoherently but significantly, the white middle class, too—have fled the Democratic Party because of its abandonment of the firm materiality of class politics for the soft superfluities of culture and identity." An earlier and more instructive moment in this unfolding dynamic came with Hilary Clinton's infamous "basket of deplorables" remark. Clinton had clumsily attempted to state an obvious political reality: that many right-wing voters would enthusiastically vote for Trump because they heard and supported his promises of racial exclusion and cruelty, and that these were policy-motivated voters to whom a Democratic ticket could not possibly make any overtures. The far-right seized predictably upon the comment by inverting its logic, saying Clinton called anyone who might vote for Trump deplorable (when in fact her point had been to describe a non-deplorable, that is not-primarily-motivated-by-racist-policy-proposals, contingent who might be moved to vote for Trump or perhaps could still be moved not to). It was a well-practiced twist not just from a statement into its (il)logical converse but also from a political point into a cultural grievance: _you, who wield the cultural power to term our desire-for-cruelty deplorable, are the real problem that necessitates we embrace cruelty to acquire political power_. The campaign's apology for the remark, much more than the original remark itself, performed a crucial task for the far-right—both in proving the efficacy that this kind of inversion could carry across the political spectrum and in helping those Republicans who might have deplored some of Trump's ideas focus instead on the fear that they themselves were already deplored by Clinton and her allies.

3) The far-right, by persuading its supporters that they do not wield political power, succeeded in producing the paradoxical conditions that could precipitate a violent insurrection—described even as a "revolution" by its participants—_in support of a sitting president_. Already, in response, we see centrist and left-of-center commentators mobilizing familiar assumptions that accord with the right's empowered account of powerlessness. CNN initially labeled Trump's goons as "anarchists" rather than "monarchists," before a consensus had formed among media outlets to distance the attackers' political goals from discussion and focus only on the social unacceptability of their tactics by calling them either a "mob" or "terrorists." In ongoing coverage, the rioters are described as delusional rather than powerful, even as evidence grows that their numbers included many military and police-force professionals and that they sustained direct strategic contact with right-wing politicians during the assault beyond what their instructions from the President provided. Meanwhile, anger mounts on the left at the Speaker of the House for not exercising more punitive power than is actually at her disposal, combining with but also diluting outrage at the fact that Republican officials who control the Senate and cabinet are happy to let Trump finish out his term and remain eligible to resume a second in 2025 (despite their also being slated for destruction by his mob; so goes the unsavory but rewarding work of political coalition). Above all, the omnipresent calls for _unity_ and for _healing our divisions_ insist that the real problems are not in the direct, violent contest for political power that we all just witnessed but rather in a more ambient cultural conflict—a sphere in which both the right and center-left agree that the left wields too much influence and, by implication, should therefore shoulder the blame.

The right-aiding assumptions that center-left pundits help repeat did not, mercifully, prevent a president who couldn't be brought to care about a pandemic or a Senate Majority Leader who couldn't bring himself to allow meaningful economic aid from delivering their respective branches of government to the Democrats. Those assumptions will become even more impactful, though, when the party finally does wield the political power they have chastised themselves for supposedly wielding for so long. It will require a change of philosophy and the abandonment of a tried-and-true commentary genre if the various strategists and pundits who mediate between a Biden administration and its supporters are to stop apologizing for the power they have earned and instead exercise it. If they don't exercise it, they will make a case to left-leaning voters that there is little point in turning out to reelect them; and they will prove to the reactionary right that murderous sedition is yet another means for power-seeking that it can expect to reuse without repercussion.
