<h3>Project Proposal: Stream Percussion (Andy Stuhl)</h3>

<p>I've been developing a sound process I call "stream percussion." The process takes a continuous source of sound, such as a radio signal, a looping buffer, or a sustained note, and feeds it through an envelope generator to produce short bursts. My interest in this idea started from thinking about what arguments are made about sound and what types of listening are enforced on us by the notion of "streaming" as a delivery of musical experience. I think of percussing, in this case, as one strategy of active listening â€” as selectively striking or silencing types of always-on sound that are designed for our passive reception, and thereby harnessing them in a new construction.</p>

<p>By tuning a radio in between stations and feeding it through this process (implemented in SuperCollider), a performer can produce snare- and cymbal-like noise bursts. Playing with the tuning and positioning of the physical radio vary their intensity and timbre, while adjusting parameters of the envelope generators effect their shape and timing. Based on my experiments using this system to improvise with other musicians, I find that the process is well suited to rhythmic accompaniment as well as to phasing patterns. It works best when enough attention can be paid to the radio so as to produce lively timbral variations and to allow the occasional snippet of voice or music to leak through into the performance.</p>

<p>My proposed performance will feature this process in an ensemble piece that foregrounds a productive opposition between "stream" sounds and percussive sounds. Players of instruments like woodwinds or guitars will produce sustained notes, while two performers will use radios and laptops to form a percussion pattern. Another performer will use the "streaming percussion" process with the sustained notes as input and will focus on adjusting the phase of the envelopes so that a shifting system of amplified "nodes" in the stream evolves among the ensemble.</p>
