<h1 id="cue-tones">Cue tones</h1>
<p>I snapped this photo last fall in the special collections reading room at Stanford. Sitting in a box of miscellaneous tape reels appended to the Ampex Corporation Records, this reel represented my best shot at getting closer to a technology that Ampex had brought to market in the mid 1950s and would quietly abandon by the end of the decade. Labeled “Music - Demo Copy, Auto Station” and dated to 1955 in the finding aid, this reel seemed like it might have something to do with the Ampex S-3380 automatic programming system, a product that I believe facilitated the first automated broadcasts to air on American radio.</p>
<p>Thanks to the generous help of Tim Noakes and Henry Lowood at the Stanford Libraries, the digitized audio from the reel was online soon after I returned from the trip, and I’ll play a short snippet of it now.</p>
<p>This tape’s music was peppy but not exactly revelatory. But I did find what I was looking for, there in the gap between songs. You probably didn’t hear it, because it was a smooth sine tone at 25 Hz, barely within the range of “normal” human hearing and outside the frequency response of most loudspeakers. This tone was put there to trigger an action from the S-3380 system, namely to stop the tape player that played it and start a second one. A program tape and an announce tape could in this way switch back and forth to carry out a full automatic radio broadcast.</p>
<p>I start with this example not just because it’s the earliest but also because I think it pulls to the fore a weird set of contradictions that arise when we look at radio automation as a part of radio history. The content I was after, this 25 Hz cue tone, is specifically inaudible and was specifically not content. These are infrastructural sounds. Filtered out of the broadcast signal before it reached transmitters, it was radio-making but never radiophonic.</p>
<p>Virtually no trace of the S-3380 remains in Ampex’s text and photo archives, though by a kind of miraculous stroke of luck I was able to get this manual from that other archive, eBay. But the technology that Ampex called “automatic programming” did not die off when Ampex turned its attention away from the radio industry in favor of vastly more profitable new tape recording applications in video and computer data storage. It was picked up by a colorful array of corporate and independent industry players and, by 1960, stuck to the now more familiar term “radio automation.” Despite Ampex’s exit, the 25 Hz cue tone standard would endure all the way into the satellite era as the basic foundation of radio automation. It was an unremarkable technique in the eyes of the various engineers who developed it in the 1950s, and, by their accounts, it emerged almost as an automatic side-effect of magnetic tape recording and its use to pre-record radio program material. That equivalence between tape and automation brings me to my more pragmatic point: namely, that the material components of automated radio have been relatively durable compared to the outputs of most radio broadcasting. There are ways of remembering and reviving automated radio, in other words, that aren’t available for other kinds of historical broadcasts. But for that to matter, we need to know why automated radio would be worth remembering and reviving.</p>
<h1 id="revivalists">Revivalists</h1>
<p>When radio automation matured in the early sixties under a combination equipment sales and content subscription model that the owners of Muzak initiated, it opened into a period that I semi-jokingly call the golden age of automated radio. Program services shipped tape reels to subscriber stations around the country, with those 25 Hz cue tones embedded at the ends of music blocks to make way for local ads and announcements.</p>
<p>These program services started out hewing closely to what the Muzak people called “adult music” or what subsequent formats would term “beautiful music” or “easy listening.” But by the early 70s, companies like International Good Music and Drake-Chenault pushed automation into top-40, rock, country, and other formats. A set of Drake-Chenault program LPs are held at the Middle Tennessee State University, but a much larger range of this material, as far as I can tell, circulates outside of formal archives through enthusiast communities. These communities intersect with other non-academic radio preservation efforts, very often led by career radio engineers, including aircheck collectors and the massive text digitization undertaking behind worldradiohistory.com. The nostalgic esteem that these enthusiasts hold for perceived high-quality program services like Drake-Chenault, combined with the large quantities in which these automation tapes were duplicated each week, means that they make up a large part of automated radio’s historical and material record. But where it really gets interesting, for me, is that the automation <em>equipment</em> also circulates through these channels. For time’s sake I’ll talk over this wonderful video that a hobbyist radio engineer named Todd Edwards shot of the full, working early-80s-era automation system he’s restored in his basement.</p>
<p>We might call this historical reenactment. Edwards and other fans of what’s erroneously termed “analog automation” post updates on their restoration progress that elicit lots of excited, nostalgic, and at times baffled responses from fellow engineers, many of whom recall countless finger-destroying hours of troubleshooting tape cartridge carousel mechanisms and the like. This love-hate fixation adds a strange technophilic spin to the forms of nostalgia directed at American radio’s other “golden age” and at the heyday of rock and roll radio.</p>
<p>The fact that automation had already helped erase people from the scene of the radio studio does not make it any less troubling that nostalgia for this golden age also tends to erase contributions to radio by anyone other than white men in engineering or ownership roles. The desire for charismatic, entrepreneurial, technologically adept heroes helps explain why Paul Schafer, who entered the radio automation business a few years after Ampex but played a crucial role in popularizing it, is almost universally described as the “father of automation” in historical coverage produced by this milieu. Schafer deployed misogynistic marketing tropes, here introducing his Schafer 1200 system as “Sylvia, radio’s perfect employee, who never asks for a raise, and never takes a day off.” And even prior to Schafer, automation promoters relied not just on economic arguments but also on the specific desire for the absence of the DJ, who in the 50s was still a pretty novel figure and one understood as a vector for transgression of racial boundaries.</p>
<p>All this to say, basically, that the fact of automation as a major presence in radio – and especially the equivalence between recording and automation – might trouble some of the attachments that motivate radio preservation in the first place. There is, I think, an undeniable allure to the possibility of reanimating the sonic and technical components that produced radio in a particular historical moment, and this possibility is available in many cases for radio that was automated. At the same time, it’s impossible to equally preserve the context that automation stripped out – that it even, as a tool of management against labor, helped to suppress in its own moment. The challenge, then, is to try to restore the cultural frictions that radio automation tried to render inaudible. This has been the aim of my dissertation work, and it’s also something that I’ve tried out from an artistic angle during a fellowship with the transmission arts organization Wave Farm, and you can hear a version of my piece “25 Hz” here in this room on Saturday morning alongside live performances by more recent fellows. But more to the point, I think there’s an avenue to this kind of effort within the automation restoration projects that Edwards and others are doing – an inevitable resurfacing of technical weirdness that with slightly different intentions could become a productive kind of media archaeology.</p>
<p>All of us doing cultural broadcast history are indebted to the hard work that historians like Lyn Spigel, Michelle Hilmes, and Susan Douglas did to push past the great inventor narratives that had dominated what Shawn Vancour calls the “first wave” radio historiography, and we don’t want to risk reverting to a technological deterministic outlook – something that is hard to avoid with regard to automation, a technology that has determined the output of radio stations around the world for seventy years now. I believe automation is an important focus within the “third wave” that Vancour has charted, where we might tune into a middle level of production techniques and practices and amend what Susan Murray has called a “marginalization of the technical.” As Murray has shown with her work on color TV, there can be no clean separation between the technical workings of a medium and the cultural representations it transmits. The components of automated radio present a politically charged and materially durable reminder of that fact, one that has already produced new forms of preservation and might stand to invigorate others.</p>
