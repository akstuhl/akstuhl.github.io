Probably the best two pies I've made yet. Heavy/ambitious toppings but crispy crust throughout. I think this was the first time getting all of the following things right at the same time:

- Take the dough balls out of the fridge about an hour before assembling.
- Make a cooked sauce, using some tomato paste (roughly two tbsps paste and 5 whole peeled tomatoes, blended).
- Freeze the (freshly shredded) mozzarella for ~15 minutes before assembling.

This is probably the third or fourth batch I've made since getting a pizza peel for Christmas, but the first I've managed to write up. The peel has made a world of difference. I assemble the pizzas on it, and even with wet toppings added slowly, the dough slides off really well as long as I've put down enough semolina. I've found that dough will contract back inward if I put it directly onto the semolina'd peel right after hand-stretching, so I try to let the dough rest on the higher-traction work surface for a few minutes first; this seems to make it hold its size/shape better.

Toppings this time: spinach, ricotta, and roasted garlic for the first one; Italian sausage and arugula (post-bake) for the second. I pre-cooked the sausages, garlic, and spinach together in the skillet. The only thing I would do differently would be to mix a little salt into the ricotta rather than adding lumps of it straight out of the container.
