Despite a more vigorous starter (when I mixed the dough, it had just started subsiding after a lot of bubbling on top), this half batch of levain dough again didn't seem to rise very much overnight. The dramatic drop in temperature, with snow today after two very sunny days in the 60s, surely didn't help. I divided the dough into three balls after 14 hours, making smaller balls this time in order to try making smaller, round pies with puffier outer crusts than last time.

I also changed it up from last time by assembling the pies on a "pizza peel" (actually just a cutting board with a little handle) instead of directly on the baking stone, even though the latter technique seems to produce a reliable balance of thoroughly cooked crust and non-scorched cheese. I thought I might be losing some oven spring due to having the door open for as long as it takes to put the toppings on. The first pie (with basil and pepperoni) stuck to the board despite what I thought was enough corn starch, and the door was open probably just as long while I wrestled it onto the stone. It tasted adequate but wasn't worth photographing. The second pie, though (mushrooms and a little white onion), transferred very smoothly. This one had a noticeably better rise than any recent effort, even in the center. The crust, though just a little undercooked, was really enjoyableâ€”light, springy, and crisp on both the bottom and edges, with more moisture and flavor than I'm used to. I think this pie had either a bit too much cheese or just needed longer in the oven, as the cheese was excessively gooey in the center despite heavily browned spots. I think it'll be worth buying cheese with a higher melting point, or rather scorching point if that's a thing. I will also continue to keep an eye out for semolina, as there was definitely a corn smell upon opening the oven after I really tried to be extremely liberal with the cornmeal for that second pie. Another note: I didn't use the broiler at all this round (well technically for maybe half a minute on the second pie, but I doubt it did anything); I continue to suspect it's not useful unless I had outer crust bubbles with some serious height to them.

The verdict: the smaller pie with a puffier crust is worth pursuing, if I can avoid undercooking; there's plenty more room for improvement with the dough rise and oven spring, which I hope warmer weather will help facilitate.
