A pretty good batch of 3 pizzas. I wanted to try a partly whole-wheat crust, which I'd never done before. The sourdough starter had hibernated too long, so I used the "same day straight pizza dough" recipe from the Ken Forkish book instead of the usual "overnight pizza dough with levain." I missed the sourdough taste, but the whole wheat worked surprisingly well, flavor-wise. The dough was much harder to work with – one ball tore so much right away that I bunched it back up and ended up not using it – but performed well enough in the oven.

Another first here was a vegan pizza, which also turned out (I thought) much better than expected. I used a chunky sauce, put on baby spinach and mushroom slices (tossed together in a splash of olive oil and salt) for toppings, and topped it after baking with a ground cashew and nutritional yeast grated parmesan alternative that Mom had made.

The second pizza got sliced and pre-sautéed Brussels sprouts and sliced onion for toppings (definitely worth repeating) along with shredded-then-frozen mozzarella, and the third was just sauce and cheese. I left the third in several minutes longer than I meant to and it got quite dark in places but tasted better than I thought it would.
